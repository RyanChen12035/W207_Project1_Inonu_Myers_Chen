# W207 Applied Machine Learning Final Project
In this analysis we create a model to predict credit card defaults from a dataset containing demographic information about credit card holders and account information like credit limits, payment status, and payment and bill histories.

The idea for this project came [Kaggle]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset)) with the original datasource from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository]([url](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients)https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients)
